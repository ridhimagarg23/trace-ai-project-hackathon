schemas.py
==========
Pydantic models (data contracts) shared across TraceAI.

These schemas are the typed backbone of every agent exchange and
give us three guarantees:

1. **Agent outputs are validated** the moment an LLM response is
   converted into a model (wrong types / missing fields fail fast).
2. **Field ranges are enforced** (e.g. ``confidence`` must be 0-100).
3. **Serialisation is free** - ``model_dump()`` turns an object into
   the plain dict that ``MemoryManager`` persists or the API returns.

The three agent result types mirror the three LLM agents:
``InvestigationResult``, ``ConversationResult`` and ``ReportResult``.
